# DKP Verifier
This is a program that verifies a derived keypair construction proof and returns the public key.

It uses a proof from the DKP generator program as an example of how to manage derived keypairs but also how to compose proofs.

In this example it is assumed that one would use the dkp gen locally and allow the prover network or adhoc users to use the dkp verify program to figure out if a key is derived from a public key.
