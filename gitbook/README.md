# Welcome

## Welcome to Bonsol

Welcome to the official documentation for Bonsol, the verifiable computation framework designed to extend Solana's computational boundaries. Our mission is to allow developers to build complex, computationally-intensive applications on Solana without being constrained by its native limitations.

## What is Bonsol?

Bonsol is a Solana-native verifiable computation framework that enables developers to:

* **Off-load complex computations** off-chain while maintaining on-chain verifiability
* **Remove computational constraints** by generating cryptographic proofs for resource-intensive tasks
* **Maintain security and trust** through zero-knowledge proofs that can be efficiently verified on Solana
* **Build previously impossible applications** with unlimited compute potential

Bonsol transforms Solana from a place where only certain things are possible, to one where _anything_ is possible.

## Why Bonsol?

Solana has established itself as a high-performance blockchain with ultra-fast transactions and low fees. However, as applications grow more sophisticated, they face inherent limitations:

* Fixed compute unit (CU) caps per transaction
* Transaction size limitations
* Constraints on complex logic execution

Bonsol breaks through these barriers by providing a decentralized prover network and developer toolkit that brings infinite computation to Solana-based applications.

## Key Features

* **Unlimited Compute Power**: Execute computationally intensive operations off-chain
* **On-Chain Verifiability**: Produce succinct, constant-size cryptographic proofs regardless of computational complexity
* **Native Solana Integration**: Seamlessly connect with existing Solana programs and resources
* **Privacy-Preserving Capabilities**: Support for private data proofs without exposing sensitive information
* **Community-Driven Development**: Open-source foundation with contributions welcome

## Use Cases

Bonsol enables a wide range of applications previously impossible on Solana:

* **Verifiable Agents**: Autonomous, provably secure agents operating without human intervention
* **Storage and Transaction Proofs**: Prove historical ownership or specific on-chain events
* **Provable Game Engines**: Build complex game mechanics by outsourcing simulations off-chain
* **Private Liquidity Pools**: Create pools where balances are provable without revealing participants
* **Cross-Chain Activity Proofs**: Enable secure cross-chain operations with trust-minimized proofs
