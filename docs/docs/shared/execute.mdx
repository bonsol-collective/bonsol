### `execute`: Requesting Execution

Being able to request a one off execution is a key feature of Bonsol. This allows you to prove computations that are impossible to run on-chain.
You can do this with the cli, using the `bonsol execute` command.

```bash
bonsol execute -f execution-request.json
```
Since there are quite a few options for how you can request execution, the cli takes a json file as an argument.
Here is an example of a valid execution request json file.
```json
{
  "imageId": "20b9db715f989e3f57842787badafae101ce0b16202491bac1a3aebf573da0ba",
  "executionId": "9878798-987987-987987-987987",
  "tip": 100,
  "maxBlockHeight": 100,
  "inputs": [
    {
      "inputType": "Public",
      "data": "<base64 encoded data>"
    }
  ],
  "callbackConfig": {
    "programId": "your program id",
    "instructionPrefix": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "extraAccounts": [
      {
        "address": "",
        "role": "writable"
      }
    ]
  },
  "executionConfig": {
    "verifyInputHash": true,
    "forwardOutput": true,
    "inputHash": "<hex encoded sha256 hash of the input data>" //sha256 hash of the input data if omitted the hash will be calculated
  }
}
```
Many of the fields can be overridden with cli flags, the only required fields in the execution request json are
* "imageId"
* "executionConfig"
And the only way to set a callback config is through the json file.

For example you can keep the execution file lightweight by using the cli flags. And make a input full for changing inputs or even pipe the json into the command.
Also if you omit the execution id the cli will generate a random one for you.

#### Waiting
If you pass the `--wait` flag to the cli, the cli will wait for the execution to be completed and then return the result.

```bash
bonsol execute -f execution-request.json --wait
```
When a node claims the execution, the cli will notify you with a message.
```bash
Execution 9878798-987987-987987-987987 claimed by 6zT31kLCj8yM1RnJuiCbhHyybxsEGuvr8DP2biNi6j7o
```
The default timeout for the cli is to wait until the expiry block, you can change this with the `--timeout` flag.
If execution is not completed within the timeout, the cli will return an message.
```bash
Error: Execution 9878798-987987-987987-987987 timed out
```
If the execution request expired without being claimed, the cli will return an message.
```bash
Error: Execution 9878798-987987-987987-987987 expired
```
When everything is successful, the cli will return the result of the execution.
```bash
Execution 9878798-987987-987987-987987 completed successfully
```
