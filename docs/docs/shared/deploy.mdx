### `deploy`: Deploying a Bonsol Zk Program

After building your zkprogram with "bonsol build ...", you can deploy it via the bonsol cli.

You have a few options for how you want to deploy:
Manual
S3

#### Manual
You can always upload your program anywhere on the internet as long as its publicly accessible by the relayer network.
Bonsol is very strict that the size of the bytes must match the size expected from the onchain deployment record.
Manual deployment can be a cause of bugs and mismatches in this regard so we dont recommend it.

To deploy manually you can use the following command.

#### S3
You can upload your program to s3 and have it be accessible by the relayer network. This is the recommended way to deploy your program.

Upload your program to s3.
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket {bucket_name} \
    --region {region} \
    --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint={region}
```

```bash
bonsol deploy s3 \
    --bucket {bucket_name} \
    --access-key {access-key} \
    --secret-key {secret-key} \
    --region {region} \
    --manifest-path collatz/manifest.json \
    --storage-account s3://{bucket_name}
```
