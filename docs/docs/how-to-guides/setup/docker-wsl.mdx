# Docker Setup for WSL

:::tip Recommended for WSL Users
For Bonsol development in WSL, we strongly recommend installing Docker directly in your WSL environment rather than using Docker Desktop for Windows. This guide will walk you through the recommended setup.

This guide explains how to set up Docker in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for Bonsol development.

## Why Docker in WSL vs Docker Desktop?

When developing with Bonsol in WSL, we recommend installing Docker directly in your WSL environment rather than using Docker Desktop for Windows. Here's why:

1. **Better Performance**: Native Linux Docker provides better performance than Docker Desktop
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Lighter weight than running Docker Desktop
3. **Development Integration**: Direct integration with WSL development environment
4. **Simplicity**: No need for Windows/WSL interop layer

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

### 2. Add Docker's Official GPG Key

```bash
# Create directory for keyrings
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download and add GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Set permissions
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

### 3. Add Docker Repository

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

### 4. Install Docker

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### 5. Configure User Permissions

```bash
# Add your user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply changes to current session
newgrp docker
```

### 6. Verify Installation

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Notes

- Docker daemon starts automatically with WSL
- No Docker Desktop required
- GUI features available through Docker Desktop later if needed
- Compatible with all Bonsol development requirements

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues after installation:
1. Ensure you've logged out and back in after adding your user to the docker group
2. Or run `newgrp docker` to apply changes in current session

If Docker daemon isn't starting:
```bash
sudo service docker start
```

## Next Steps

Once Docker is installed, you can proceed with the [Bonsol quickstart guide](/tutorials/quickstart) to begin development.
